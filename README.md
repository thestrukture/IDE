- Autocomplete between different files.
- Syntax correction.
- Server process management.
- Interactive terminal via web socket.
- Line tags in relation to failed build logs.
- Project build scripts.
- View web application output.
- Build docker images (Must have docker running on host) . 

## Requirements
- Go v1.13+.
